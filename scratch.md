Darby on the run. Darby along a reclaimed dirt track running. It's dark, but
there is some *aurum* on the air; there is spillover from the still-hidden sun
sprinkling among the leaves, the branches, the buds faintly iridescent with dew.

Darby in shoes scuffing the dirt and the patches of scrub. The path goes up and
down. Her footfalls careen into loess-filled fossae; her ankles torque and cry;
in mere steps she scambles up a deeply-shadowed hillock and launches into the
space between two back-turned ashes. Lands pitched forward and scabbing her
hands, tracking through and off the tired foliage of an old cypress.

What can she hear? Chirps and wing-throbbing charivaris, already out of place as
the murkiness settles out. Her footsteps, too rapid and irregular, kicking dirt,
slipping, tripping, stomping th ground. Her breath in piledriver blows. But
also, akin to hearing: the ick and slide of her limbs accreting sweat, the trail
of fluid from her nose upon her upper lip, and a kind of infraharmonic
reverberation with the dew, the isolated puddles, the sand oaks' pecked-out
cavities cradling water. Wet sand and dirt on her calves and shins subtilizing.

She skirts a clearing to her right. A doe and her fawn flash out of the opposite
end, into deeper forest cover.

The track is deeper-cut, the vines more withered-back.

She slows to a walk, then to heavy steps, propping her arms on her hips. Her
right eye burns from a trickle of sweat.

Blush is smeared over the eastern horizon. She sees herself as yet indistinct
from the ash trees, dim bands and dimmer bands askew- and crosswise laid. It is
getting lighter. Her smock, soiled as it is, is bleached canvas. Her blouse is
over-sunned *pome*. Her skin is pale and light-veined between the clingy clods
of sod and sand. The woods are still umber and sallow, like sickly greens
crawlig with aphids.

How far can she have run? Miles, like. Her feet are sodden and sloughing.
